# Adonis RFCs
> Give your ideas some life :)

Many small changes to the API and bug fixes can be done without creating any RFC. However, we may ask you to create a formal RFC for changes of the following nature.

- Adding an entirely new API or module to the eco-system.
- Changing the behavior of an existing feature.
- Features that are not clear and requires more discussion and community involvement.

## How to know if RFC is required?

> Feel free to join the [discord server](https://discordapp.com/invite/vDcEjq6) and ask it on general channel. If you think, you need more guidance, then feel free to ping `@virk` on Discord.

RFC is required, when the feature cannot be implemented separately and should be added to the core or the eco-system of first party plugins.

If you think, a feature can be added and maintained as a 3rd party add-on, then there is no need of RFC. Just work on the feature, let us know, and we will be happy to spread the word.

## Getting started

Adding a new feature, or changing behavior of an existing feature is a big responsibility. Make sure to spec out the feature clearly and explain clear use cases.

A general template for creating an RFC can be.

1. Define the problem you are trying to solve.
2. A bigger picture of the feature and how it will work as a concept.
3. Technical details

Another important aspect is to make sure that the feature is within the scope of [AdonisJs philosophy]().

## Creating your first RFC

Let's get started together and create your first RFC. 

1. Click [here](https://github.com/adonisjs/rfcs/issues/new) to open a new issue.
2. Add the title of the issue. For example **Adding GraphQL as the first-class citizen to AdonisJs**.
3. Fill out the issue template. If you think any section is irrelevant, write `NA.`
4. Double check the issue and submit it.
5. Normally someone from the core team will give appropriate labels to the issue and get in touch with you in a couple of days.
6. If you think your RFC is waiting for the response for a more than 7days, please feel free to reach `@virk` on Discord server, or email `virk[at]adonisjs[dot]com.`
